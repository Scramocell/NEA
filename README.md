# NEA
This is my NEA A level project to develop an AI that can play Chinese Checkers against 5 other entities. Originally the game will be 1v1 with two agents this will slowly scale to 6v6. The final plan is to be able to play a 6v6 game without having 5 other people to play with.

# Reinforcement 1
This is my first prototype of reinforcement learning, it is copied from a tutorial by 'Sentdex', a great youtube programming tutorial channel, as part of his reinforcement learning course. I claim no ownership of the code except for a few variable name changes to improve readability.

The idea was to get an understanding of Q learning before I started my project to see if it was feasible. I was mainly focusing on building my own environment, rather using prebuilt ones, as I would have to do in my final project.
